# Gate Garden - Phaser Game

A game inspired by Bosch's ["The Garden of Earthly Delights"](https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/art-work/the-garden-of-earthly-delights/02388242-6d6a-4e9e-a992-e1311eab3609). Talk to the mystical animals, solve their puzzles, and earn medals to open the ancient gate.

I love finding ways to combine art and technology. Exploring new tools is even more fun when I get to mix them with Boschâ€™s paintings.

**Made with:** Phaser 3, TypeScript, and Vite. The game also includes a webhook for remote control of settings (disabled by default).
